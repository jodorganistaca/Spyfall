  "instructions": "Spyfall is played over several rounds, and at the start of each round all players receive cards showing the same location — a casino, a traveling circus, a pirate ship, or even a space station — except that one player receives a card that says \"Spy\" instead of the location. Players then start asking each other questions — \"Why are you dressed so strangely?\" or \"When was the last time we got a payday?\" or anything else you can come up with — trying to guess who among them is the spy.
